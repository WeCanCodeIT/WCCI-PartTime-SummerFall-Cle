### Skills Needed:
  - HTML/CSS

### Things to Think About:
This project requires that you map out your entire page before starting to code. Decide where you want your pictures in relation to the text needed. Think about the usability of the site as well. If you were a customer visiting it, what information would you want to see first? Aesthetics matter when designing a website, you want something that is functional and that also draws in customers.
