# House University Website
Objective
Create a website for a “House University” that tracks student’s courses and enrollment.
Your website should be based on two models, Student Information and Course Information.  Plan your database before you start any migrations to support these models.  Also, make sure your menu bar is functional before doing any styling of the site.

### Skills: 
* Code First Database Design
* MVC Knowledge 
* HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
* Requirements
  * Your house website should represent your house’s themes. The nav bar should direct the user to the appropriate pages to the Student Section and the Course Section.  Each section should have separate pages for creating, editing and / or deleting a student or course. 

They should also be able to navigate back to the “Home” page. Each of those pages should be styled.  Make this as “non-bootstrappy” as you can!  We don’t want to see any of the standard bootstrap formatting from the base template.  Use www.bootswatch.com as a resource for styling your site.
## Student Section
This section of your website should show a list of students that are currently enrolled in your House University.  It should also allow for the creation of new students, editing of students and removal of old students.

Each student should have the following information (required fields are starred):
* Student ID*
* Name*
* Birthday*
* Enrollment Date
* Two other custom fields of your choosing

The student should be able to pick from a list of courses that they want to take.  The list of courses should be in a drop down list.

## Course Section
This section should have a page that lists all of the courses that are available at your university.  It should also have separate pages that allows for adding a new course, editing an existing course and removing and old course.

Each course should have the following fields (required fields are starred):
* Course ID*
* Course Title*
* Course Description*
* Number of Credit Hours*
* Two other custom fields of your choosing
* View Enrolled Students
- This should be a listing of the students who are currently enrolled in a class.  You can format this information any way you like, but make the list readable and well organized.  You should be able to see the students’ name, contact information and the course or courses they are enrolled in.
### Stretch Goals 
Create a “Professor Section” that will allow for the viewing of all professors at your university.  Also add separate pages each for creating, editing, and deleting professors.
