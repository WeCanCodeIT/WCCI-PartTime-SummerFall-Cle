## Presentation Resources 

### Final Presentation

Presentations will be 10 minutes long followed by 5 minutes for questions from the audience. In your presentation you should: 
- Identify the problem the app addresses. 
- Why is the app unique in addressing that problem. 
- Briefly mention technology used, not specific details. 
    - For instance “Saying something like "we incorporated the Google Maps API" or "we built this as a database-first MVC application" is good, but saying something like "on line 145 you'll see that the JSon Result compiled by the controller’ will be harder for people to follow.  
    - The idea is to have enough tech talk to appeal to techy employers, but not get too bogged down by tech stuff so that recruiters or non-tech representatives of employers can still follow along. 
- Every member of the group is required to speak. 
- Interaction withaudience is good: 
    - Example: [Yoga Rx Presentation](https://wecancodeit.org/portfolio-item/yoga-rx-quickly-relieve-your-aches-and-pains-without-medicine/) 

**Common Presentation Follow-Up Questions:**

- If you had more time what would you work on/Where would you take this next? 
- What was the most difficult part of the project? 
- What are you technically most proud of in this project? 
- What was your role in this project? (This question shouldn't really occur if you did a good job covering this during your presentation) 
- Tell us about how your project was managed. 
- How much longer would you have needed to complete all of your goals?  
  
**Networking Questions Include:** 

- What was your favorite part of the bootcamp? 
- What did you find the most difficult? 
- What are your goals? 

_Keep in mind that the networking part is mostly conversational, and less like a formal interview. So just remember to be yourself and have a good chat._
