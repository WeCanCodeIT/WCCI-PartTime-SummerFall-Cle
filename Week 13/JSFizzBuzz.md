## Javascript FIZZ BUZZ

Create a JavaScript function that loops 1 through 100. When a number is divisible by 5, have it print BUZZ if it’s divisible by 3 it’s FIZZ, if it’s divisible by both, print FIZZ BUZZ. If it's neither divisible by 5 nor 3, just print the number. Make sure each FIZZ, BUZZ, FIZZ BUZZ, or number is on it's own line.
