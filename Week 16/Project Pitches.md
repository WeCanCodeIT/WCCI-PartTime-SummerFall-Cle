- Watch the following video on how to pitch + [Bizimply Win Web Summit](https://www.bizimply.com/resources/Bizimply-Win-Web-Summit-2015/)
- With your pitch in mind be sure to consider how all the aspects of your training a We Can Code IT will be utilized. Front-end, back-end, styling, and controller logic. Try to stray away from ideas that are just informational sites as those won't touch much back-end programming.
- Build a list of resources that may be useful if you project is selected e.g., APIs, C# libraries, Open Source projects, etc. Here are a few resources to get you started to help you get started 
  + [50 Most Useful APIs for Developers](https://www.computersciencezone.org/50-most-useful-apis-for-developers/)
  + [15 APIs Developers Should Know About](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/apis-developers-need-know-121518469)
- Document and refine your pitch. Devote some time to practice it, if you can try practicing in front of friends of family. Some past project presentations 
- Remember, all students need to pitch and each student wil have up to 5 minutes and up to 2 minutes for questions. 
 If you are able you can do some field research for your project by reaching out to people or ORGs. Most people are more than happy to provide input for an educational project.
- Be sure to include what skills you're looking for on your team. Front end, database, someone who is good with APIs etc. 

_**Projects we will not be doing:**_ Urban Gardening/Farming, Pet Rescue stuff, Food-to-Food-Pantry apps. Versions of these have been done in the past and we want to keep presentations original. 

- Selection will be done by a panel of judge. We choose projects based on originality and feasibility.
