## C# Practice Problems

**1. Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.** _Taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview" pg. 95 Solution p. 216_
  
**2. Given two strings write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.**
Eg: cat and act are permutations of each other.
   _Taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview" p. 90 Solution p.193_
 
**3. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.** You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the “true” length of the string. 
   _Taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview" pg. 90 Solution pg. 194_
	
**4. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?** 
   _Taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview" p.90 Solution p.192_

 
**5. Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.**
   Example: Tact Coa
   Output:     True: (permutations; “taco cat” , “acto cat” etc.”)
   _Taken from "Cracking the Coding Interview" p.91 Solution p.195_

**6. Write a method that prints the multiplication table up to 10 to the console.**
   
**7. Write a method that takes in two integers, adds, them and then prints out the largest int in that new integer.** 
   For example: The two numbers 66 and 19 are taken in. Their sum is 85 so 8 is printed to the console. 
	
**8. Print all the prime numbers between 1 and 100 to the Console.** 

**9. Write a method that takes in two doubles, multiplies them, and then prints “Greater than 100” to the console if that new number is greater than 100.** 

**10. Write a method that checks to see if two strings have the same amount of letters.** 

**11. Write a program that prints the integers from   1   to   100   (inclusive). For multiples of three, print Fizz     (instead of the number) For multiples of five, print Buzz (instead of the number) For multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz (instead of the number).**

**12. Write a method that takes in a string and then outputs the number of times the letter "a" appears. For an extra challange, make it case insesnsitive.** 

**13. Write a C# method to total all the even numbers in an array of ints.**
