# White Boarding Strategy 
### Why Whiteboarding? 
  - Companies that choose to include whiteboarding in an interview do so for many different reasons. It may be because they have a history of it, because it's part of their culture, or maybe just like watching Junior Devs squirm because they had to back when they were starting out.
  - Not all companies test developers this way. Some may give them a test, or some katas to solve, or pair program with them through an example project. These companies feel that giving prospective clients a "real world problem" is a better way to test their technical knowledge. It's important to be prepared for all scenarios.  
  **So what's the point?**
    - To test your knowledge.
    - To see you how you communicate.
    - To see how you interact with others. 
    - To understand your thought process.
    - To learn how you worked through a problem, either one you know or one you don't!
 ### Before the Interview
* Get very comfortable with syntax The syntax of a for loop, foreach loop, how to initialize a string or an array. 
* Practice String and Array Manipulation. Research helper methods that do the work for you! 
* Practice whiteboarding problems! Ideally, do them standing up at a whiteboard with other people watching you. You can also practice writing syntax on a piece of paper. Use a computer to check your code once you're done. 
* Mentally Prep Yourself - Power poses work! Don't believe me? Watch this Ted talk on the subject [Amy Cuddy: Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are)
### What is the Interviewer Looking For?
  * They want to know how you talk through a problem. What ideas are running through your mind? What questions do you immediately have?
This is a collaborative process, so don’t be afraid to include the interviewer. 
### Steps to Follow
1. Once you get the question, repeat it back to your interviewer in your own words. 
2. Write it down, including the steps you will need to solve it. 
3. Ask the interviewer clarifying questions. Write down the answers to these questions along with the problem; think of them like clues. 
  -Why? It makes you more likeable and explains your thought process. Remember, they want to see how you work through problems.	
4. Write out pseudo code: basically English to show what you’re going to do; don't sweat the syntax right now. 
5. Start the method you will use and make sure you have the correct return type. Declare any variables/strings/arrays you may need and set up any loops. 
5. Keep talking! Even if you are stalling because you don't know something, you may get some information from the interviewer. If they offer a hint, be curious and follow up. Why? It makes you likeable and explains your thought process. Remember, this test is designed to see how you work through problems.
8. Once you've gotten down everything you can, go back and clean up your code, add syntax, punctuation etc. where you can. Keep breathing and keep talking!
9. At this point it’s not out of the question to ask the interviewer what they would do, or how they might proceed from here. Do they notice something that you’re “missing”? 
10. Throughout the feedback, stay engaged and ask questions! If you didn't know something, engage them about it and learn something new!

#### _If they ask you something YOU DON’T KNOW AT ALL_
Admit you’re not familiar with it. Say what you have been focusing on and why. 
Example: “Reverse a matrix in place.” 
Answer: “I just graduated from a boot camp that focused on .Net and C# programming so we did not learn about working with a matrix. I did learn about arrays, string, and did problems like “FIZZ BUZZ” and multiplication tables.
