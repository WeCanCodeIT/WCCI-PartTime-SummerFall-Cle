### Do it 
- Create a method called WageCalculator.
    - It should take two `double` parameters. One should represent the hours worked and the other represent the hourly wage. The return type should be of type of `double`.
    - The method should calculate the monthly wage.
    - Once it calculates the monthly wage it should return that value 

----

- Create two methods of your choosing. At least one of the methods should have a non-void return type.
    - Both of the methods should take at least one parameter
    - Remember when naming your method that it should represent what your method should do.
    - Your method should only aim to accomplish one thing.
    - Be creative.
