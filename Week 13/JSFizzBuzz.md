## Javascript FIZZ BUZZ

Create a JavaScript function that loops 1 through 100. When a number is divisible by 5, have it print BUZZ if it’s divisible by 3 it’s FIZZ, if it’s divisible by both, print FIZZ BUZZ. If it's neither divisible by 5 nor 3, just print the number. Make sure each FIZZ, BUZZ, FIZZ BUZZ, or number is on it's own line.   

* Step 1. 
Make a new Web project. 

* Step 2.
Make a button. 

* Step. 3
 When the button is clicked the program prints either FIZZ, BUZZ, FIZZ BUZZ, or the number (one result per line) to the web page. 

## Example 
Looping 1 - 5
* Results should be
<br/>
1<br/>2<br/>FIZZ<br/>4<br/>BUZZ


## Stretch Tasks
* Allow for user input to determine the number you are counting up to.<br/>
* Allow for user input to determine the numbers used as variables for FIZZ, and BUZZ.<br/> 
* Style your FIZZBUZZ project, adding images, changing colors, fonts, and more.<br/>
* Extra extra stretch: Allow users to change the colors and css styles used on the web page (change to dark theme or light theme on the press of a button, for example).
